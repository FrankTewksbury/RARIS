# Sports Nomenclature Rules

## 1. Football Disambiguation (CRITICAL)

**The term "Football" is AMBIGUOUS and MUST NOT be used alone.**

| Input Term | Canonical Sport | Examples |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Football | **AMBIGUOUS - DO NOT USE** | - |
| Soccer | Soccer | Premier League, MLS, La Liga |
| Association Football | Soccer | FIFA, UEFA competitions |
| American Football | American Football | NFL, NCAA, CFL |
| Gridiron | American Football | XFL, USFL |

### Rules
- NEVER use standalone "Football" in code, comments, database fields, or data structures
- ALWAYS map league names to explicit sport types before processing
- When source data is ambiguous, check secondary features (pitch dimensions, quarters vs halves)

---

## 2. League-to-Sport Mapping

### American Football Leagues
- NFL, NCAA (FBS/FCS), CFL, XFL, USFL, Arena Football

### Soccer Leagues
- Premier League, MLS, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Eredivisie, Liga MX

---

## 3. Team Name Conventions

### Naming Hierarchy
| Priority | Type | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Primary | Canonical full name | "UCLA Bruins", "Alabama Crimson Tide" |
| Secondary | Short name / Alias | "UCLA", "Alabama", "Bama", "Roll Tide" |

### Rules
- Store and display **canonical names** as the primary identifier
- Allow short names and aliases for search and user input
- Use case-insensitive matching for duplicate detection
- Strip athletic suffixes ("Bruins", "Tigers", etc.) when checking for duplicates

## 4. Quick Reference

```python
# Correct usage
sport = "American Football"  # NFL game
sport = "Soccer"             # Premier League match

# INCORRECT - Never do this
sport = "Football"  # Ambiguous!
```
