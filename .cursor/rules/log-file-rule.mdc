# Overview

This rule defines logging standards for all scripts including console output colors,
file logging structure, and naming conventions.

---

## RULE: Logging Standards (Required)

### 1. Initialization

- All scripts MUST initialize logging before executing any operational logic.

- Logging setup MUST be implemented as:
  - a shared logging module, OR
  - a dedicated logging initialization function.
  Inline or duplicated logging configuration in individual scripts is NOT allowed.

- If the `logs` directory does not exist, the logging module/function
  MUST create it at runtime.

- Logging failures MUST NOT fail silently.
  - Errors during logging initialization MUST be surfaced clearly.

---

### 2. Console Output Colors

Console messages MUST use the following color scheme:

| Level              | Color         | ANSI Code       |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| HEADERS            | **GREEN**     | `\033[92m`      |
| INFO / Normal text | **WHITE**     | `\033[97m`      |
| DEBUG / Warnings   | **YELLOW**    | `\033[93m`      |
| ERROR / Critical   | **RED**       | `\033[91m`      |
| NODE PROCESSING    | **PURPLE**    | `\033[95m`      |

- Headers follow the `print-header-style` rule (Major: `===`, Minor: `---`)
- All header text in console MUST be GREEN
- Node processing messages (e.g., retrieving teams) MUST be PURPLE with minor header format
- Use colorama or ANSI escape codes for cross-platform compatibility

Example color constants (Python):
```python
class LogColors:
    HEADER = "\033[92m"   # Green - for headers
    INFO = "\033[97m"     # White - for info/normal
    DEBUG = "\033[93m"    # Yellow - for debug/warnings  
    WARNING = "\033[93m"  # Yellow - for warnings
    ERROR = "\033[91m"    # Red - for errors
    CRITICAL = "\033[91m" # Red - for critical
    NODE = "\033[95m"     # Purple - for node processing
    RESET = "\033[0m"     # Reset to default
```

### 3. Log File Types

All log files MUST be written to a subdirectory named `logs`
located in the same directory as the executing script.

Three separate log files MUST be maintained:

| Log Type      | Contents                                           |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **General**   | All operational events (startup, config, actions, shutdown) |
| **Debug**     | DEBUG level messages only (for troubleshooting)    |
| **Error**     | ERROR and CRITICAL messages with full stack traces |

- All errors MUST also be logged to the general execution log.
- Debug messages MUST also be logged to the general execution log.

---

### 4. Log File Naming Convention

Log files MUST follow this naming pattern:

```
<script_name>_<log_type>_<YYYYMMDD>_<SEQ>.log
```

**Components:**
- `<script_name>`: Name of the executing script (without extension)
- `<log_type>`: One of `general`, `debug`, or `error`
- `<YYYYMMDD>`: Date in ISO format (e.g., 20260111)
- `<SEQ>`: 3-digit sequence number, zero-padded (000-999)

**Sequence Number Rules:**
- MUST be exactly 3 digits, zero-padded (e.g., `000`, `001`, `042`)
- MUST start at `000` for the first execution of each new day
- MUST increment by 1 for each subsequent execution on the same day
- Resets to `000` when the date changes

**Examples:**
```
main_general_20260111_000.log   # First run of the day
main_debug_20260111_000.log
main_error_20260111_000.log

main_general_20260111_001.log   # Second run same day
main_debug_20260111_001.log
main_error_20260111_001.log

main_general_20260112_000.log   # First run next day (resets to 000)
```

---

### 5. Log Format

All log files MUST follow the established project log formatting:

```
[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [SOURCE] MESSAGE
```

- **TIMESTAMP**: ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm`)
- **LEVEL**: Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **SOURCE**: Module or function name
- **MESSAGE**: The log message

Error logs MUST include full context:
- Timestamp
- Severity
- Source
- Message
- Stack trace (where applicable)

### 6. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Logging initialized before any operational logic
- [ ] Shared logging module or function (no inline config)
- [ ] Console colors: GREEN headers, WHITE INFO, YELLOW debug/warn, RED error
- [ ] Three log files: general, debug, error
- [ ] Logs written to `./logs/` directory (auto-created if missing)
- [ ] File names: `<script>_<type>_<YYYYMMDD>_<SEQ>.log`
- [ ] Sequence: 3-digit, starts at 000, resets daily
- [ ] Errors logged to both general and error logs
- [ ] Debug messages logged to both general and debug logs
